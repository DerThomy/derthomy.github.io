# Hi, I'm Thomas KÃ¶hler ðŸ‘‹
_PhD Researcher in Visual Computing_ at
Graz University of Technology

I started my PhD in May 2025 with [Markus Steinberger](https://www.markussteinberger.net/) as my supervisor. I explore the intersection of **computer graphics, neural rendering, and scene understanding**. My research focuses on developing **efficient and scalable techniques** for representing, synthesizing, and visualizing 3D scenes â€” from **Gaussian Splatting pipelines** to **dynamic scene generation and completion**.  

I am particularly interested in pushing the boundaries of **real-time graphics** and **interactive visual computing**, making complex 3D scenes accessible and actionable for both research and applications.

On this site you can find my **research projects**, **publications**, and **demos** showcasing my work. I also maintain links to **code repositories** and **project pages** for many of my papers.

When Iâ€™m not experimenting with graphics pipelines, you might find me **visualizing neural representations**, sketching out new ideas for interactive scene generation, or exploring the latest trends in **real-time rendering**.
